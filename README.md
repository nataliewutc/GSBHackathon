## Inspiration
With the pandemic keeping people at home, it has been hard to keep fit. With the limited equipment most of us have at home, it's hard to perform the workouts we want to. Therefore, we were inspired to create something that would allow people to workout effectively at home by selecting the equipment they have and our site will provide a workout routine tailored for it. Another one of our inspirations came from the fact that women are hugely disadvantaged at the gym due to the fear of being body shamed, sexualized and mansplained to are extremely high compared to men. Therefore, we created this online gym for women and non-binary folk. A place where they can feel safe and comfortable to continue on their fitness journey.

## What it does
Our app allows users to select the equipment they own at home (e.g. Chair) and will present the user with a set of workouts tailored to what they have so they could still be able to achieve their fitness goals at home. Moreover, there are live videos on our site for gym classes that users can attend where they can also comment and ask the host questions so that they feel like they're part of a community even if they're at home. Other functionalities include workout video suggestions, a profile where users can track their progress and a music player so users can listen to music whilst working out.

## How we built it
Front-end: html, CSS (partly coded on Glitch) 
Back-end: python, Flask
Github
Heroku

## Challenges we ran into
With front-end, it was difficult to style the CSS as we wanted due to the amount that we had to style for our webpage. It was also challenging when it came to formatting the website how we wanted to. However, with a lot of team work and help from mentors, we managed to present our website like we imagined it to be. With back-end, it was challenging to code the function so that a workout tailored to the equipment is shown when the buttons are pressed. Also as we were beginners with web dev, we had to learn on the go when it came to fully running the website cohesively.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of how we have come together as team and tackled all our challenges. Moreover, our site displays all the functionalities that we wanted to include and we feel very accomplished that we can show users what we can offer. We are also proud of the future that it shows and excited to be able to develop it further even after this hackathon. Although we didn't have time to fully implement all the functions of the web page, we are proud of the Create a Workout function where users can have a unique set of workouts from the equipment available to them and the embedding of youtube videos.

## What we learned
It has been a great experience and chance to learn how to work together as a team and be there for each other when we needed help. We also learnt how to divide work effectively so that everyone can enjoy their task whilst learning. The importance of market research and content creation was also highlighted during this project due to the product's heavy reliance on content. It was a great opportunity to learn how to code collaboratively so that everything fits together nicely - we communicated every few hours so that we could be updated with what the whole team was doing. An extremely rewarding experience overall. 

## What's next for Her Health
We definitely want to add more functionalities to our webpage for example adding a spotify widget using their API so that users can listen to their favorite music whilst working out at home. Moreover, we plan to fully implement all the functionalities to our webpage so that users can enjoy our product !
